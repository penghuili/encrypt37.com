They have access to database, but not your password and private key.

<br />

They see this:

## Apart from the encryption, File37 also provides:

- View all files in a timeline like Instagram;
- Upload multiple files at once in a post;
- Organize posts with tags;
- Filter posts by date range;
- One click to cover your screen (I call it **the Door**);

## Pricing

You get 600GB of storage. If you need more, let me know.

You can try for free for 14 days, no card required.

After that it's only $6 per month or $60 per year.

*Your payment info is not saved, I don't want your persomal info (Same as [Mullvad](https://mullvad.net/en)). So there is no subscription, you need to buy new ticket after (or before) your account is expired.
